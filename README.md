This is a productivity management system for teams developed for the android system.

It allows people to create groups and add team members. Team members will be able to do the following:
1. Access a team board which can contain multiple todolists and notes
2. Access to a real time texting service supported by firebase.

*(This project was a school project/ experiment with UI design - the firebase server might have been closed by now)*
